#Android Workshop for Beginners

## Introduction
This workshop is aimed at intermediate Java or OO programmers who want to start with Android development. As a prerequisite we ask you to setup a working Android development environment. Please check if you have already installed-, or download and install the following software on your computer:

* A [Java Software Development Kit (JDK)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) version 6 or higher. A Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is not enough!
* The [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html) bundle, which includes: 
  * The Android Studio early access preview IDE, which is based on the community edition of IntelliJ IDEA. 
  * All the Android SDK Tools to design, test, debug, and profile your app. 
  * The latest Android platform to compile your app. 
  * The latest Android system image to run your app in the emulator
* Fire up Android Studio and check that you have the latest Android SDK platform, SDK Tools, SDK Platform tools installed. You can access the SDK manager by clicking on the SDK Manager Icon ![SDK Manager Icon](img/sdk-manager-studio.png) in the toolbar. Your configuration should look something like this

* Preferably we would like you to connect your phone to your computer and run and test the samples on a real device. If you don't own an Android device you can install an Android emulator, also known as an Android Virtual Device (AVD). Install at least one Android Virtual Device (AVD) running Jelly Bean, but preferably KitKat. All the capabilities of the AVD Manager are accessible directly from the Android Studio interface. Click the AVD Manager Icon ![AVD Manager Icon](img/avd-manager-studio.png) in the toolbar to open it and create new virtual devices for running your app in the emulator. **Note: If you connect your Android device to a Windows machine make sure you have installed the correct device driver for your Android device.**
