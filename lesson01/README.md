## Android Studio

### Importing an Android project in Android Studio
Android Studio contains a new project wizard which is started by chosing **File > New Project...**. However convenient it also poses a lot of questions, settings and steps which might be a bit too much at this point. For this workshop we would like to teach you how to import an existing Android project so we can keep the project contents consise to what is needed in the sample or exercise. In this lesson we are going to import a very tiny "Hello World" app.

In Android Studio, chose **File > Import Project...** and select the `sample01` folder. Android Studio may ask you to choose the type of project you are importing. If this is the case, make sure to choose **Import project from external model** and select the **Gradle** option.
